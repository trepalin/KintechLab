SRU polymers SMILES
Datasets, used in the article "New polymers in-silico generation and properties prediction"

Abstract:
Open source datasets result in polymer structures optimization and new polymer generation

Datasets:
Approximately 5M polymer SRU, structures obtained by optimizing the properties of polymers: ZeroTwo.zip
Approximately 800K polymer SRU, resulting from the generation of new polymers - MonteCarloSmi.zip
Approvimately 4.4M polymer SRU, resulting in the extremal properties design - MonteCarloAll1.zip and MonteCarloAll2.zip
